        <p>For the past 2 or 3 years, as I've tried reconnecting with my reading hobby, I discovered I really like historical fiction (is that what this genre is called? What I mean is realistic fictional books set at least a few decades ago). I've read and loved most of Jane Auten's books, and I really liked politically heavy books like Harper Lee's <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> and Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>. Overall, I've been enjoying reading many classics, so if you have any similar suggestions <a href="https://the-displeasure.atabook.org" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">feel free to tell me</a> <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(to be considered: I <i>have</i> already read many classics, like some of Orwell's books, a little Shakespeare, <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and a few others that aren't listed on my "Finished" list, as I've prioritized my most recent reads.)</span></p>
        <p>Surprisingly for me, I've found that I also quite enjoy non-fiction historical and/or political books. From <i>The Prince</i> to Argentinian feminist Florencia Freijo's books, I've had a great time reading these essay-books, <i>although</i> I have to confess they are a bit of a heavy read to pair with my studies and I can only read them if I'm well-rested (rare).</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In a completely unrelated book genre, I've also given Terry Pratchett's <i>Discworld</i> books a try and I've loved them so far (I've only read 2 and I'm trying to get a physical copy of the third). I think my liking of his books might be the only legacy left over from my fantasy-filled childhood. Apart from that, as I've grown older I've found it harder and harder to like excessively fansastic and magical books...</p>
