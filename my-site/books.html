    <p>I have loved reading ever since I've known how. It was my first hobby, and there was a time when I'd occupy all my free time with books.</p>
    <p> As years have gone by, as it has happened to many, I've found less and less time for reading, and in the little time I do have I rarely have the energy to do so. Since starting University, it's been almost impossible to finish more than 1 or 2 books per year.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In an attempt to get myself to read more, I've decided to keep an online footprint of my thoughts on the books I read. So, here are some of the books I've read or I'm currently reading, and the impressions I had while doing so. </p>
