    <p> Hii, I'm <mark>Jinx</mark>, the webmistress of this site. Glad this place interested you enough to want to know more about me!</p>
    <p> I'm a mathematician by day, physicist by night and full time lesbian who has many more interests than time to indulge them all, and is perpetually tired (unsuprisingly). I sing in a choir (fellow altos hmu!!), and I like drawing, reading, studying languages, playing guitar, attempting silly diy projects and coding simple sites recreationally :) </p>
    <p> I live in Argentina, which presents its own benefits and difficulties, and my main language is Spanish. I disgrace my country by being irredeemably bad at football and a vegetarian, and honour it by loving tango (one of my favourite genres to sing) and possibly drinking more mate than is advisable. </p>
    <p> I'd usually describe myself as a huge nerd, not only because I'm waay too into studying and learning, spending most of my time at University —as I take an absurd amount of classes per semester—, but also because I think I approach every aspect of life and every single small task I encounter in the nerdiest way possible. A nerd lifestyle, if you will. I enjoy approaching tasks in methodical ways, I like knowing all the little details behind everything I do, and I get very excited whenever I can learn something new.</p>

        <summary><span><h3 class="yellow">About my name <img src="emotes/updated.gif"> </h3></span></summary>
        <p> I've been using the online name Jinx since 2019, after watching the entirety of <i>Teen Titans (2003)</i> with my youngest sister and thinking the character Jinx had a nice design. </p>
        <p> My real life name, Sofía —careful, use it wisely—, is insanely common, which has always been an issue. From finding available usernames to identifying myself among my namesakes (which there are always too many, in all group settings), my very simple name has brought me many hardships (<i style="font-size: small;"><- exaggeration</i>), that have resulted in me gaining many nicknames that I've come to attach a great feel of identity to, sometimes more so than to my real, legal name. </p>
        <p> Like so, Jinx has stuck as my e-name for the past few years, and will likely continue to stick around for awhile longer. </p>
